# Security

Research into what this repository should say about security on .NET 10. Security has no opinion file of its own. It lives in two places: [aspnet-core.md](../opinions/aspnet-core.md) covers passkeys, API challenge responses, rate limiting, CSRF and the reverse-proxy contract, and [ci.md](../opinions/ci.md) covers SHA pinning, script injection, token permissions, pinned builds, signing and Renovate. This topic checks both against the roster and maps the ground between them.

**This is the second pass.** The first, on 2026-09-11, ended by nominating seven sources, because the ground it could not cover was mostly application security. The `vet-source` pass of 2026-09-12 (#67) settled them: `damien-bowden` admitted at Tier 1 unmarked, `khalid` widened to his Duende blog byline, and `barry-dorrans`, `duende-blog` and `scott-brady` watch-listed. This pass sweeps what that made citable.

**The three findings from the first pass stand unchanged, and the gap map moves.** Four areas that were blocked, thin or unvetted are now sourced, one correction lands on a roster judgment this topic itself made, and the two remaining gaps are narrower and better understood.

1. **The house warnings rule now fails restore on every new advisory.** For `net10.0` projects NuGet Audit checks transitive packages by default, and [templates/Directory.Build.props](../templates/Directory.Build.props) sets `TreatWarningsAsErrors` unconditionally. Reproduced on SDK 10.0.400 against a fresh project: `error NU1903: Warning As Error: Package 'Newtonsoft.Json' 12.0.1 has a known high severity vulnerability`, with restore exiting 1. An advisory published against anything in the graph turns a green commit red with no change to the repository. The recommendation is to keep that behaviour and write it down ([NuGet Audit under the house warnings rule](#nuget-audit-under-the-house-warnings-rule)).
2. **ci.md's publishing advice has been overtaken.** It offers "trusted publishing / scoped API key stored as a repository secret" as equals. Trusted publishing has been GA since 2025-09-22, and from 2026-08-17 nuget.org caps new API keys at 30 days, with every older key expiring on 2026-11-01. The opinion should name trusted publishing and demote the key to a fallback ([Publishing credentials](#publishing-credentials)).
3. **The container-first hosting opinion walks into the Data Protection key ring.** aspnet-core.md says to ship a container image and says nothing about where the keys that protect authentication cookies and antiforgery tokens live. `ms-learn` says a container must keep them on a persistent volume or in an external store, and documents a trap: choosing an explicit location silently turns off encryption at rest ([Data Protection in containers](#data-protection-in-containers)). Of the application-security gaps, this is the one the repository's own advice leads straight into.

**What the second pass changes:**

- **Browser authentication and BFF are now fully sourced.** `damien-bowden` is the unmarked Tier 1 depth source the first pass could not find, and `khalid` adds the .NET 11 consequence ([Browser clients](#browser-clients-cookies-not-tokens)).
- **The security-headers gap closes.** `damien-bowden` publishes a concrete header baseline and a CSP nonce approach for Blazor, and he independently recommends the library that the first pass could only reach through its own maintainer ([Output encoding, CSP and security headers](#output-encoding-csp-and-security-headers)).
- **The passkey `amr` defect is citable and confirmed open.** It carries a filed ASP.NET Core issue, and it bears on an opinion this repository already publishes ([section 1](#1-what-the-repository-already-says-checked)).
- **Password-based key derivation gains a current source,** in place of a Learn page reviewed in 2021 ([Cryptography on GA APIs](#cryptography-on-ga-apis)).
- **A correction this topic owes.** The first pass ranked Barry Dorrans the strongest candidate. The roster found idunno.org has been a blog only since 2025-11-18, so the strongest name it nominated is the one that cannot be cited ([item 7](#what-this-reveals-about-the-repository)).
- **Still blocked:** API-key handling, and which analyzer security rules to enable.

One unvetted source still carries a claim below and is flagged where it appears: the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/), which the `vet-source` pass did not take up. Philippe De Ryck was checked in the first pass and is out of scope, having published no .NET-specific writing and nothing since 2022.

## 1. What the repository already says, checked

**Passkeys first** holds, and the caveat the first pass could only report as rumour is now citable and open. ASP.NET Core Identity on .NET 10 returns `amr=pwd` after a passkey sign-in, where the OpenID Connect Extended Authentication Profile calls for `pop`. `damien-bowden` reports it as a framework defect: "At present, this is not implemented correctly in ASP.NET Core (.NET 10)." ([Bowden: Set the amr claim when using passkeys authentication in ASP.NET Core](https://damienbod.com/2026/01/05/set-the-amr-claim-when-using-passkeys-authentication-in-asp-net-core/), 2026-01-05). It is filed as [dotnet/aspnetcore#64881](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64881), "The amr claim is set incorrectly when authenticating using passkeys", opened 2025-12-28 and still open on 2026-09-12. His workaround signs out to clear the cookie, then signs in again through `SignInWithClaimsAsync()` with the corrected claim, because the existing claims collection cannot be mutated in place.

**This is a caveat aspnet-core.md's passkeys opinion should carry.** Anything downstream that reads `amr` to decide whether a sign-in met a step-up or multi-factor bar will misjudge a passkey until the fix ships. It does not weaken the opinion, since the passkey itself is what it claims to be, and the defect is in how the sign-in is described afterwards.

**Rate limiting** holds, and `code-with-mukesh` corroborates the per-node framing from the other direction: "If your deployment has more than one replica, your in-memory rate limiter is not enforcing what you think" ([Mukesh: Rate Limiting in ASP.NET Core (.NET 10)](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/rate-limiting-aspnet-core/), 2026-05-21). He adds that partition keys "must be validated and bounded", because every distinct key allocates a limiter. `milan-jovanovic`'s older advice that "Rate limiting by IP address can be a good layer of security for unauthenticated users" ([Jovanović: Advanced Rate Limiting Use Cases In .NET](https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog/advanced-rate-limiting-use-cases-in-dotnet), 2023-08-19) reads against the opinion's "never by raw client-controlled input like spoofable IP headers", but the two are compatible. On the editor's reading, the connection's remote address is not client-controlled while a forwarded header is, and the forwarded-headers middleware that the hosting opinion requires is what decides which of them `RemoteIpAddress` reports. The opinion would be clearer for naming that.

**CSRF defence in depth, and its "Coming next" aside,** are accurate, and Lock's follow-up sharpens the aside. The .NET 11 middleware is on by default for apps built with `WebApplicationBuilder`. Minimal APIs and Blazor SSR can drop `UseAntiforgery()` and rely on it alone, whereas MVC and Razor Pages keep token validation: "There's basically no simple way today to opt into _only_ using the new approach." Cross-origin requests are rejected unless their origin is in the CORS allowed-origins list, and requests with no browser signals are allowed through. ([Lock: Automatic CSRF protection based on Fetch Metadata headers](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-the-dotnet-11-preview-6-automatic-csrf-protection-based-on-fetch-metadata-http-headers/), 2026-08-04). .NET 11 reached RC 1 on 2026-09-08 with GA expected in November 2026 ([Microsoft Learn: What's new in .NET 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-11/overview), reviewed 2026-09-08), so the aside stays preview-labelled for now.

**`khalid` supplies what that change does to an identity flow, which is the sharpest new argument in this pass.** A SPA that exchanges an authorization code at the token endpoint makes a cross-origin POST, and "It's cross-origin. It's a POST. It will be rejected." He also flags an unresolved case: a provider callback using `response_mode=form_post` is "a cross-origin form POST from the provider's domain", and whether the middleware will treat it as legitimate is not yet settled. ([Abuhakmeh: Understanding .NET 11 Automatic CSRF Protection](https://duendesoftware.com/blog/20260901-understanding-dotnet-11-automatic-csrf-protection), 2026-09-01). His fix is the Duende BFF framework, which is the product recommendation his roster row says never to carry alone; the mechanism, that a same-origin backend "sidesteps most of these issues", is what this repository takes from it.

**A .NET 8 rule belongs beside the CSRF opinion and is missing.** Since ASP.NET Core 8, "Minimal API endpoints that bind a parameter from the form via IFormFile or IFormFileCollection require anti-forgery validation" ([Microsoft Learn: Minimal APIs antiforgery checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/breaking-changes/8/antiforgery-checks), reviewed 2023-12-05).

**The hosting opinion credits SDK container publish with keeping "the base image patched with the SDK".** That is true at build time only. An image nobody rebuilds keeps the runtime it was built with; [Servicing](#3-servicing) takes up the cadence.

**ci.md's pinning, injection and permissions opinions** drew no new evidence either way. Its signing section is the second finding above.

## 2. Supply chain

### NuGet Audit under the house warnings rule

The mechanism, from `ms-learn`: audit runs during restore and is on by default, and "`NuGetAuditMode` defaults to `all` when a project targets `net10.0` or higher. Otherwise `NuGetAuditMode` defaults to `direct`." A multi-targeted project uses `all` if any of its frameworks selects it ([Microsoft Learn: Auditing package dependencies for security vulnerabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/concepts/auditing-packages), reviewed 2025-10-01). Severities map to NU1901 (low) through NU1904 (critical). A .NET 9 preview briefly shipped `all` and the 9.0.101 SDK reverted it ([Microsoft Learn: NuGetAudit audits transitive packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/10.0/nugetaudit-transitive-packages), reviewed 2025-03-28).

`dotnet-blog` puts a number on the noise. .NET 10 also prunes platform-provided packages from the graph before auditing it, and "Projects with these defaults have 70% fewer transitive vulnerability reports compared to projects using the previous defaults" ([Kolev: NuGet Package Pruning: Cleaner Dependencies and Actionable Vulnerability Reports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/nuget-package-pruning-in-dotnet-10/), 2026-05-18). `meziantou` covered switching audit on while it was opt-in ([Meziantou: Enable NuGet auditing for your .NET projects](https://www.meziantou.net/enable-nuget-auditing-for-your-dotnet-projects.htm), 2024-07-15), which .NET 10 has made moot.

The interaction with this repository is documented rather than inferred: "If these warnings are causing restore to fail because you are using `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, you can add `<WarningsNotAsErrors>NU1901;NU1902;NU1903;NU1904</WarningsNotAsErrors>` to allow these codes to remain as warnings." ([Microsoft Learn: NuGet Warnings NU1901, NU1902, NU1903, NU1904](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1901-nu1904), reviewed 2024-07-19). The reproduction above confirms it on the SDK this repository pins.

**Recommendation: keep NU1901–NU1904 as errors, and say so in the template.** The **House:** warnings rule exists so that a problem fails where it is introduced, and a known vulnerability in the shipped graph is such a problem. The escape valve already has the shape the house rule demands of every suppression: `NuGetAuditSuppress` takes an advisory URL ([Microsoft Learn: Excluding advisories](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/concepts/auditing-packages#excluding-advisories)), and an entry carrying its reason in a comment is what the rule already requires of `#pragma` and `<NoWarn>`. Two consequences should be written down with it, because they surprise people:

- A release branch that has not changed will stop restoring on the day an advisory lands against its graph. That is intended, but it means servicing a release branch starts with triage.
- `WarningsNotAsErrors` is the one-line way out, and it switches the house rule off for exactly the class of warning where failing loudly matters most.

`ms-learn` offers one more option, and the house rule rejects it outright: "If you would like to run NuGet Audit on developer machines, but disable it on CI pipelines, you can take advantage of MSBuild importing environment variables, and create a NuGetAudit environment variable set to `false` in your pipeline definition." That inverts ci.md's own argument that a check which fires in only one place fires a day late.

### Publishing credentials

Two `dotnet-blog` posts overtake ci.md's "trusted publishing / scoped API key stored as a repository secret":

- **Trusted publishing is GA.** A workflow uses "a short-lived GitHub OIDC token to request a temporary, single-use NuGet API key", and "These keys expire quickly (≈1 hour)" ([Tvorun and Iyer: New Trusted Publishing enhances security on NuGet.org](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/enhanced-security-is-here-with-the-new-trust-publishing-on-nuget-org/), 2025-09-22).
- **Long-lived keys are going away.** "Starting August 17, 2026, new API keys will be limited to 30 days. All existing API keys created before that date will expire on November 1, 2026." The post strongly recommends moving to trusted publishing ([.NET Team: Strengthening NuGet Supply Chain Security: Reducing API Key Lifetime](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/strengthening-nuget-supply-chain-security-reducing-api-key-lifetime/), 2026-08-03).

`andrew-lock` walks through the setup and states the reason plainly: "managing the lifecycle of long-lived secrets is notoriously difficult" ([Lock: Publishing NuGet packages from GitHub actions the easy way with Trusted Publishing](https://andrewlock.net/easily-publishing-nuget-packages-from-github-actions-with-trusted-publishing/), 2025-09-30). The `ms-learn` page carries two review dates, 2025-07-01 and 2026-07-29 ([Microsoft Learn: Trusted Publishing](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/trusted-publishing)).

**Recommendation: trusted publishing is the opinion.** An API key is the fallback for a host that cannot present an OIDC token, and it now needs an owner for rotation because it dies in 30 days. The ci.md sentence cites `meziantou` and `ms-learn` today; a rewrite would cite `dotnet-blog` and `andrew-lock`, so the file's `sources:` grows.

### Package source mapping and lock files

**Source mapping closes dependency confusion.** `meziantou` describes the attack: "If you have a package published on an internal feed... with the same name as a public package, the public package can be used instead." His remedy is "You can use package source mapping to prevent this issue." ([Meziantou: NuGet Packages: security risks and best practices](https://www.meziantou.net/nuget-packages-security-risks-and-best-practices.htm), 2024-12-02). `ms-learn` agrees and scopes it: mapping "can be used to improve your supply chain security, especially if you use a mix of public and private package sources", set up in one root `nuget.config` with `<clear/>` and a pattern covering every package ([Microsoft Learn: Package Source Mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-source-mapping), reviewed 2026-07-16). It also names a limit: mapping filters restore, but not `dotnet package add` or the `--vulnerable` listing. The template set has no `nuget.config`, which is where this would land.

**Lock files are where the sources frame one feature three ways.** The template's comment presents `packages.lock.json` as optional protection "against feed drift". `ms-learn` presents lock files as repeatability for CI. `meziantou` presents them as integrity: "The lock file contains the package hash. If a corrupted or malicious package is downloaded, NuGet detects it and fails." ([Meziantou: Faster and Safer NuGet restore using Source Mapping and Lock files](https://www.meziantou.net/faster-and-safer-nuget-restore-using-source-mapping-and-lock-files.htm), 2022-08-01). His is a claim about mechanism and it is correct: CPM pins a version, and only the lock file pins content.

What the hash buys depends on the feeds. The editor's reading, not a sourced claim: a version published to nuget.org cannot be overwritten, so on nuget.org alone the hash adds little, whereas behind a mirror or a private feed it is the only check on content. That makes source mapping and lock files one decision for multi-feed repositories, and not a pressing one for single-feed repositories.

### SBOM and provenance

`andrew-lock` is still the only citable source, across a three-post series: generating an SBOM for a NuGet package ([Lock: Creating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for an open-source NuGet package](https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-for-an-open-source-nuget-package/), 2025-03-25), provenance attestations ([Lock: Creating provenance attestations for NuGet packages in GitHub Actions](https://andrewlock.net/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/), 2025-03-18), and signed SBOM attestations with `actions/attest-sbom` ([Lock: Creating SBOM attestations in GitHub Actions](https://andrewlock.net/creating-sbom-attestations-in-github-actions/), 2025-04-01). `ms-learn` has no page on SBOM generation for .NET builds (negative result), and `damien-bowden` does not cover supply chain at all (negative result).

**This is the gap the first pass expected `barry-dorrans` to close, and the watch-listing keeps it open.** His SBOM and package-signing posts are exactly the second voice this section needs, and they stay available for cross-checking rather than citation until the blog reaches two years. One Tier 1 author remains thin for an opinion, and nothing swept says who consumes the SBOM.

### An SDK that reports its own vulnerabilities, documented but not yet shipped here

`ms-learn` documents a property that would pair with the pinned `global.json` the way Renovate pairs with pinned action SHAs: "To detect builds running on an unsupported SDK, set the `CheckSdkVulnerabilities` MSBuild property to `true` in your project. The build then emits warning NETSDK1239 when the resolved .NET SDK is end of life." ([Microsoft Learn: .NET releases, patches, and support](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/releases-and-support), reviewed 2026-05-15). A search summary reports that the same property also enables NETSDK1238, for an SDK with known vulnerabilities, and NETSDK1240, for a discontinued feature band; the editor has not read that on a Learn page.

**It is not in the SDK this repository pins.** The installed 10.0.400 SDK contains no reference to `CheckSdkVulnerabilities` or to any of the three codes, and the Learn page does not say which feature band introduces it. Nothing to act on until it ships.

### Security analyzers

`ms-learn` documents `AnalysisModeSecurity`, which sets the analysis mode for the Security category alone and otherwise inherits `AnalysisMode` ([Microsoft Learn: MSBuild reference for .NET SDK projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props), reviewed 2026-03-27). The template's `latest-recommended` level turns some security rules on, but the documentation does not list which, and points to the SDK's `analysislevel_*_recommended.globalconfig` instead. No source swept in either pass recommends a setting, so this is mechanism, not an opinion in waiting.

## 3. Servicing

Security fixes ship on Patch Tuesday, "always the second Tuesday of the month", and `ms-learn` says to "Regularly install servicing updates to ensure that your apps are in a secure and supported state" ([Microsoft Learn: .NET releases, patches, and support](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/releases-and-support), reviewed 2026-05-15). After STS support was lengthened to 24 months, ".NET 8 and .NET 9 will reach end of support on the same day – November 10, 2026" ([Damkewala: .NET STS releases supported for 24 months](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-sts-releases-supported-for-24-months/), 2025-09-16). The repository already targets `net10.0`, supported to November 2028, so the date matters to readers bringing older projects in and to [verify-project](../skills/verify-project/SKILL.md), for which a target framework below `net10.0` is out of support in two months.

`andrew-lock`'s write-up of CVE-2025-55315 is the argument for cadence. It is a request-smuggling flaw in ASP.NET Core that "received Microsoft's highest-ever CVSS score of 9.9", and exploiting it could let an attacker "Login as a different user", "Make an internal request (SSRF)" or "Bypass CSRF checks" ([Lock: Understanding the worst .NET vulnerability ever: request smuggling and CVE-2025-55315](https://andrewlock.net/understanding-the-worst-dotnet-vulnerability-request-smuggling-and-cve-2025-55315/), 2025-10-28).

**Recommendation: tie the hosting opinion to the calendar.** A container image is patched when it is rebuilt from a patched base, so rebuild and redeploy after every Patch Tuesday whether or not the code changed. That is the editor's synthesis of the `ms-learn` servicing rule with the hosting opinion rather than a prescription any source states, and `resolve-research` should look for one that does.

## 4. Application security

### Authorization by default

`ms-learn` recommends a fallback policy that requires an authenticated user: "Setting the fallback authorization policy to require users to be authenticated protects newly added Razor Pages and controllers. Having authorization required by default is more secure than relying on new controllers and Razor Pages to include the `[Authorize]` attribute." ([Microsoft Learn: Create an ASP.NET Core web app with user data protected by authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/secure-data), reviewed 2026-05-11). Endpoints then opt out with `[AllowAnonymous]` or name a stricter policy.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorizationBuilder()
    .SetFallbackPolicy(new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .Build());
```

It has the same shape as aspnet-core.md's validation rule: secure by default, with opt-outs per endpoint, rather than opting in endpoint by endpoint. `andrew-lock` covered the `DefaultPolicy`/`FallbackPolicy` split for ASP.NET Core 3.x, which is too old to cite for current behaviour. This is the strongest candidate for an opinion in the topic: single-sourced, but uncontested and mechanical.

### Browser clients: cookies, not tokens

**This section changes most in the second pass.** The first pass had `ms-learn` and `milan-jovanovic` for the rule and nothing citable for the depth. `damien-bowden` supplies the depth, and he states the principle more plainly than either: "No authentication security logic should be implemented in a client application running in the browser", with "No JWT shared in the public (accessible from JS)" ([Bowden: Implement BFF using Auth0, Angular and ASP.NET Core](https://damienbod.com/2026/08/10/implement-bff-using-auth0-angular-and-asp-net-core/), 2026-08-10).

The mechanism is worked rather than described. The session rides in a `__Host-` prefixed cookie, marked HttpOnly and secure, with YARP putting the SPA and the API on one origin, and the downstream call uses a separate token: "DPoP used for the all access tokens". His earlier post states the rule that makes it a token-mediating BFF rather than a proxy that forwards what the browser holds: "The downstream API does not accept the user delegated access tokens from the UI application" ([Bowden: BFF secured ASP.NET Core application using downstream API and an OAuth client credentials JWT](https://damienbod.com/2024/04/08/bff-secured-asp-net-core-application-using-downstream-api-and-an-oauth-client-credentials-jwt/), 2024-04-08).

`ms-learn` carries the same rule twice over. "We recommend using cookies for browser-based applications, because, by default, the browser automatically handles them without exposing them to JavaScript", with tokens reserved for clients that cannot use cookies, and then "you are responsible for ensuring the tokens are kept secure" ([Microsoft Learn: Use Identity to secure a Web API backend for SPAs](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization), reviewed 2026-03-23). For Blazor it documents the BFF pattern with YARP proxying API calls "with the `access_token` stored in the authentication cookie" ([Microsoft Learn: Secure an ASP.NET Core Blazor Web App with OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/blazor-web-app-with-oidc?pivots=bff-pattern), reviewed 2025-12-18).

`milan-jovanovic` gives the attacker's version: "Avoid localStorage, which any XSS payload can read. HttpOnly cookies are safer for browser apps" ([Jovanović: JWT Authentication in ASP.NET Core](https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog/jwt-authentication-aspnetcore), 2026-07-04). `khalid` adds the property that removes a whole attack class, "`SameSite=Strict` cookies are not sent on cross-site requests, which eliminates CSRF as an attack vector without requiring anti-forgery tokens", alongside the plainer "`HttpOnly` cookies cannot be read by JavaScript, so even a successful XSS attack cannot exfiltrate the user's access or refresh token" ([Abuhakmeh: The Cookie Apocalypse Already Happened](https://duendesoftware.com/blog/20260414-the-cookie-apocalypse-already-happened), 2026-04-14). That post closes on the Duende BFF product, so the cookie properties are what this repository takes from it.

**Recommendation: browser apps authenticate with cookies, and a SPA or Blazor WebAssembly client that calls APIs does so through a BFF holding the tokens server-side.** Four roster sources now carry it, one of them unmarked, independent and working in code. The .NET 11 CSRF change adds urgency rather than support, since the cross-origin token exchange a browser-held-token design depends on is the thing that stops working ([section 1](#1-what-the-repository-already-says-checked)).

One operational caveat comes free with the pattern. A cookie-bound session grows, and browsers cap a cookie at about 4 KB: "The cleanest fix is to stop storing session data in the cookie entirely... The cookie becomes a thin key that points to the server state rather than containing that state itself." ([Abuhakmeh: ASP.NET Core Cookie Size Limits in Production](https://duendesoftware.com/blog/20260429-aspnet-core-cookie-size-limits), 2026-04-29).

### Tokens for APIs

`milan-jovanovic` gives the validation floor, "Always validate issuer, audience, lifetime, and signing key", and adds "Rotate refresh tokens on every use (issue a new one, revoke the old)" (same post). `code-with-mukesh` puts a range on lifetime: "15 to 60 minutes is reasonable. Since you cannot revoke a JWT once it is issued, a short lifetime limits the damage if one leaks" ([Mukesh: JWT Authentication in ASP.NET Core](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/jwt-authentication-in-aspnet-core/), 2026-06-07).

The two agree on where permissions live, and Mukesh measures the failure when they live in the token. Jovanović: "keep tokens lean and resolve permissions server-side with IClaimsTransformation" ([Jovanović: Building Secure APIs with Role-Based Access Control in ASP.NET Core](https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog/building-secure-apis-with-role-based-access-control-in-aspnetcore), 2025-09-27). Mukesh: "A revoked permission keeps working until the token expires, which I reproduced as a 201 that should have been a 403" ([Mukesh: Permission-Based Authorization in ASP.NET Core](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/permission-based-authorization-in-aspnet-core/), 2026-08-06).

**`damien-bowden` raises the ceiling of what this section can recommend.** Where the other two stop at validating a bearer token, he binds it and replaces the client secret:

- **DPoP** binds the token to a key the client holds, so a stolen token is not enough: "The access tokens should only be used for what the access tokens are intended for. OAuth DPoP helps force this." ([Bowden: Securing APIs using ASP.NET Core and OAuth 2.0 DPoP](https://damienbod.com/2023/08/14/securing-apis-using-asp-net-core-and-oauth-2-0-dpop/), 2023-08-14)
- **Pushed authorization requests** move the request parameters out of the browser redirect, configured with `PushedAuthorizationBehavior.Require`, which he notes arrived as a .NET 9 feature ([Bowden: Implement ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect OAuth PAR client with Keycloak using .NET Aspire](https://damienbod.com/2024/09/02/implement-asp-net-core-openid-connect-oauth-par-client-with-keycloak-using-net-aspire/), 2024-09-02).
- **Client assertions** replace the shared client secret with a private-key JWT, in a series running from 2025-02 to 2026-02 ([Bowden: Use client assertions in ASP.NET Core using OpenID Connect, OAuth DPoP and OAuth PAR](https://damienbod.com/2026/02/02/use-client-assertions-in-asp-net-core-using-openid-connect-oauth-dpop-and-oauth-par/), 2026-02-02).

There is a tension inside `milan-jovanovic` that an opinion should settle rather than inherit. His Keycloak post argues for handing identity to "a battle-tested identity provider" ([Jovanović: Integrate Keycloak with ASP.NET Core Using OAuth 2.0](https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog/integrate-keycloak-with-aspnetcore-using-oauth-2), 2026-02-07), while his and Mukesh's most prominent posts teach issuing your own JWTs. The editor would put the opinion at the identity provider and treat self-issued tokens as the exception. `damien-bowden`'s whole catalogue assumes an identity provider and spends its effort on how the client proves itself to one, which is the same position stated by practice.

**API keys are still blocked.** Mukesh asks for "at least 128 bits of entropy, ideally 256 bits. Generated with RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes()", storage "as SHA-256 hashes, never plaintext", and comparison with `CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals` ([Mukesh: API Key Authentication in ASP.NET Core (.NET 10)](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/api-key-authentication-aspnet-core/), 2026-05-08). Jovanović's 2023 post covers neither hashing nor comparison, and `damien-bowden` does not write about custom API-key authentication at all (negative result, checked this pass). A **Corroborate.** source cannot carry an opinion alone, so this stays blocked.

### Secrets

`ms-learn` is unambiguous: "Never store passwords or other sensitive data in source code or configuration files. Production secrets shouldn't be used for development or test. Secrets shouldn't be deployed with the app. Production secrets should be accessed through a controlled means like Azure Key Vault." The Secret Manager "doesn't encrypt the stored secrets and shouldn't be treated as a trusted store. It's for development purposes only." ([Microsoft Learn: Safe storage of app secrets in development in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets), reviewed 2026-05-13). The security overview adds managed identities as the most secure way to authenticate to Azure services.

`damien-bowden` follows the same pattern across his catalogue and shows the deployed half: user-secrets locally, and a system-assigned managed identity with `ChainedTokenCredential` to reach the vault ([Bowden: Using ASP.NET Core with Azure Key Vault](https://damienbod.com/2024/12/02/using-asp-net-core-with-azure-key-vault/), 2024-12-02). `meziantou` covers the other way secrets leak, through logs and diagnostics ([Meziantou: Prevent accidental disclosure of configuration secrets](https://www.meziantou.net/prevent-accidental-disclosure-of-configuration-secrets.htm), 2023-02-13). .NET 10 closed one such path by default: EF Core now redacts inlined constants from its logs ([.NET Team: Announcing .NET 10](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-10/), 2025-11-11).

**Recommendation: user-secrets in development, a managed identity to a vault in production, and nothing secret in `appsettings*.json`.** Two roster sources and uncontested. The redaction half cross-links to [logging.md](../opinions/logging.md).

### Data Protection in containers

The Data Protection key ring encrypts authentication cookies and antiforgery tokens. `khalid` states what it covers and why a deployment cannot ignore it: the keys are what let an app "work in a distributed environment like Windows Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or another production environment as you scale past a single host machine" ([Abuhakmeh: Data Protection for ASP.NET Core Developers](https://duendesoftware.com/blog/20250313-data-protection-aspnetcore-duende-identityserver), 2025-03-13). His earlier personal-blog post shows the same keys shared deliberately across apps behind one proxy ([Abuhakmeh: Sharing Auth Cookies With YARP, IdentityServer, and ASP.NET Core](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/sharing-auth-cookies-with-yarp-identityserver-and-aspnet-core), 2022-08-23).

`ms-learn` says where the ring must live in a container: "When hosting in a Docker container, keys should be maintained in either: A folder that's a Docker volume that persists beyond the container's lifetime... or An external provider, such as Azure Blob Storage... or Redis." ([Microsoft Learn: Configure ASP.NET Core Data Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/configuration/overview), reviewed 2025-10-08).

The key-storage page adds two traps ([Microsoft Learn: Key storage providers in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/implementation/key-storage-providers), reviewed 2025-11-07):

- "If you specify an explicit key persistence location, the data protection system deregisters the default key encryption at rest mechanism, so keys are no longer encrypted at rest." Persisting the ring without also calling one of the `ProtectKeysWith*` methods trades a restart bug for plaintext keys.
- "Redis doesn't persist data by default when restarting. This can cause Data Protection to issue new keys, invalidating previously protected data."

The configuration page adds that encrypting keys at rest "doesn't prevent cyberattackers from creating new keys", so the store's permissions matter as much as its encryption.

**Recommendation: wherever there is more than one instance or a container that restarts, persist the key ring to shared storage and protect it at rest, both explicitly.** It belongs next to the container hosting opinion, which as written produces exactly the deployment this failure needs. `damien-bowden`'s material on this is from 2016 to 2019 and too old to cite (negative result), so `ms-learn` carries the container mechanics with `khalid` corroborating the distributed case.

### CORS

`ms-learn`: "Specifying AllowAnyOrigin and AllowCredentials is an insecure configuration and can result in cross-site request forgery", and "Bypassing the built-in checks by using SetIsOriginAllowed(\_ => true) together with AllowCredentials is also an insecure configuration." Named policies applied with `[EnableCors]` give the finest control ([Microsoft Learn: Enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS) in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors), reviewed 2026-05-12).

In .NET 11 the allowed-origins list will also decide which cross-origin requests the CSRF middleware admits, so a permissive CORS policy becomes a CSRF hole as well as a CORS one. That is preview-dependent, but with `khalid`'s account of what the middleware rejects, it is a reason to get a CORS opinion in before .NET 11 ships.

### HTTPS behind a proxy

`ms-learn` extends the hosting opinion's proxy contract to TLS: "If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers... then the app doesn't require HSTS middleware." And `UseHsts` "isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers." ([Microsoft Learn: Enforce HTTPS in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl), reviewed 2026-07-29). Put simply, whichever layer terminates TLS owns redirection and HSTS. It is a sentence to add to the hosting opinion rather than an opinion of its own.

### Output encoding, CSP and security headers

Razor "automatically encodes all output sourced from variables, unless you work to prevent this behavior", and `HtmlString` "should never be used in combination with untrusted input because it exposes an XSS vulnerability" ([Microsoft Learn: Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cross-site-scripting), reviewed 2026-05-13). For Blazor, "CSP is recommended for Blazor apps". Blazor Web Apps on .NET 8 and later send `frame-ancestors 'self'` automatically, and on .NET 8 to 10 a strict policy without `unsafe-inline` styles breaks the `Virtualize` component, which .NET 11 fixes ([Microsoft Learn: Enforce a Content Security Policy for ASP.NET Core Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/content-security-policy), reviewed 2026-08-18). `andrew-lock` adds Trusted Types for client-side script, under which "APIs like `innerHTML` must be passed a `TrustedHTML` object" ([Lock: Preventing client-side cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities with Trusted Types](https://andrewlock.net/preventing-client-side-cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities-with-trusted-types/), 2025-02-11).

**The baseline the first pass could not source now has one.** `damien-bowden` publishes a concrete header set for a Blazor Web application: `X-Frame-Options` deny, `X-Content-Type-Options` nosniff, `Referrer-Policy` strict-origin-when-cross-origin, the three Cross-Origin-\* policies, a CSP with a nonce, `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS outside development ([Bowden: Implement a secure Blazor Web application using OpenID Connect and security headers](https://damienbod.com/2024/04/15/implement-a-secure-blazor-web-application-using-openid-connect-and-security-headers/), 2024-04-15). He revisits the CSP half for interactive circuits, preferring a nonce and falling back to hashes ([Bowden: Revisiting using a Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce in Blazor](https://damienbod.com/2025/05/26/revisiting-using-a-content-security-policy-csp-nonce-in-blazor/), 2025-05-26).

**It also resolves the conflict that blocked the first pass.** That pass could reach `NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders` only through `andrew-lock`, who maintains it. Bowden uses it as a third-party choice with no interest to declare: "The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders nuget package is used to implement the security headers." An independent Tier 1 source recommending the library is what the recommendation needed, so the opinion no longer rests on its author.

### Open redirects

.NET 10 closed a minimal-API gap: `RedirectHttpResult.IsLocalUrl` works without MVC, as in `if (RedirectHttpResult.IsLocalUrl(url)) return Results.LocalRedirect(url);`, and `LocalRedirect` "throws an exception if a non-local URL is specified" ([Microsoft Learn: Prevent open redirect attacks in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/preventing-open-redirects), reviewed 2026-08-26). Small, mechanical and uncontested.

### SQL injection in EF Core

"The FromSql and FromSqlInterpolated methods are safe against SQL injection, and always integrate parameter data as a separate SQL parameter. However, the FromSqlRaw method can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, if improperly used." The same split holds for `ExecuteSql` against `ExecuteSqlRaw` and `SqlQuery` against `SqlQueryRaw` ([Microsoft Learn: SQL Queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/querying/sql-queries), reviewed 2022-09-19). The review date is four years old and predates EF Core 10, but the API split has not changed since `FromSql` arrived in EF Core 7.

[data-access.md](../opinions/data-access.md) says nothing about raw SQL, and its TODO does not list it. One line would do: interpolated methods only, and a `*Raw` method never with input. It would also give that file its first `ms-learn` citation, which its source-redundancy note already points towards.

## 5. Runtime and cryptography

### Deserialization

`BinaryFormatter` is gone: "Starting in .NET 9, the in-box BinaryFormatter implementation throws exceptions on use, even with the settings that previously enabled its use." ([Microsoft Learn: BinaryFormatter disabled across all project types](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/serialization/9.0/binaryformatter-removal), reviewed 2024-08-06). An unsupported compatibility package keeps it alive for code that cannot migrate. `dotnet-blog` states the general principle: "Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen." ([Landwerth: BinaryFormatter removed from .NET 9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/binaryformatter-removed-from-dotnet-9/), 2024-08-28). `meziantou` shows the attack end to end, from a crafted payload to remote code execution ([Meziantou: Deserialization can be dangerous](https://www.meziantou.net/deserialization-can-be-dangerous.htm), 2020-01-05), which is old but describes a mechanism that has not changed. [ui-frameworks.md](../opinions/ui-frameworks.md) already mentions the removal as an Avalonia 12 migration cost.

**Recommendation: never reference the `System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters` compatibility package, and never deserialize untrusted input with a format that names its own types.** Landwerth's sentence is the rule.

### Cryptography on GA APIs

`ms-learn`'s recommended-algorithms table names `Aes` for privacy, `HMACSHA256` or `HMACSHA512` for integrity, `ECDsa` or `RSA` for signatures, `RandomNumberGenerator` for random numbers and `Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2` for password-based key derivation ([Microsoft Learn: .NET cryptography model](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/security/cryptography-model), reviewed 2021-02-26). The page is five years old, gives no iteration count and does not mention AES-GCM, so it cannot carry an opinion alone. `steve-gordon` supplies the practical AES-GCM rule: the nonce must be unique per operation, filled from `RandomNumberGenerator`, and "There is, over time, a very small chance of generating the same nonce, which can render AES-GCM insecure" ([Gordon: Encrypting Properties with System.Text.Json and a TypeInfoResolver Modifier (Part 2)](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/encrypting-properties-with-system-text-json-and-a-typeinforesolver-modifier-part-2), 2026-02-05).

**Password hashing gains a current source.** `damien-bowden` gives the parameters the 2021 Learn page omits, "a salt of 8 bytes or more... and more than 10000 iterations" for `Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2`, and names the better default for anyone using Identity, which is its own `PasswordHasher` rather than a hand-rolled derivation ([Bowden: Creating hashes in .NET](https://damienbod.com/2024/07/01/creating-hashes-in-net/), 2024-07-01). With the passkeys-first opinion already routing around passwords, the recommendation is short: let Identity hash them, and reach for PBKDF2 only when deriving a key from a password outside it. OWASP's [Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) prefers Argon2id (**unvetted**), which the BCL does not ship, and it is recorded as a disagreement below.

### Post-quantum cryptography

**Experimental as of 2026-09-12, not yet an opinion,** for everything except ML-KEM and ML-DSA, and those only on some platforms. `dotnet-blog` is the primary source. "For `MLKem` and `MLDsa` we've removed `[Experimental]` from the classes, but it remains on a few methods": `ExportEncryptedPkcs8PrivateKey`, `ExportPkcs8PrivateKey`, `ExportSubjectPublicKeyInfo` and `ImportFromPem`, under diagnostic `SYSLIB5006`. Meanwhile "we've decided to release the `SlhDsa` and `CompositeMLDsa` classes with `[Experimental]`" ([Barton: Post-Quantum Cryptography in .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/post-quantum-cryptography-in-dotnet/), 2025-11-18). Linux needs OpenSSL 3.5 or later, and Apple platforms, Android and the browser have none of these algorithms ([Microsoft Learn: Cross-platform cryptography](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/security/cross-platform-cryptography), reviewed 2026-08-03). The two sources disagree on Windows; see below.

The honest guidance at GA is narrow: ML-KEM and ML-DSA are usable where the operating system provides them, and `IsSupported` must gate every use.

### Containers run as non-root

With SDK container publish, which the hosting opinion requires, "If you're targeting .NET 8 or higher and using the Microsoft runtime images, then: on Linux, the rootless user `app` is used" ([Microsoft Learn: Containerize a .NET app reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/containers/publish-configuration), reviewed 2026-08-04). Setting `ContainerUser` to `root` undoes it. `andrew-lock` gives the reason: "if an attacker manages to compromise your container, they'll be able to do pretty much anything in the container" ([Lock: Updates to Docker images in .NET 8](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-updates-to-docker-images-in-dotnet-8/), 2023-10-17). The repository gets this for free, so the opinion is one line: never set `ContainerUser` to `root`. Chiseled images are documented on a page last reviewed 2024-08-28, which is too stale to cite for .NET 10 image choices.

## 6. Preview, not yet an opinion

Everything here is .NET 11, which reached RC 1 on 2026-09-08 with GA expected in November 2026 ([Microsoft Learn: What's new in .NET 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-11/overview), reviewed 2026-09-08).

- **Automatic CSRF protection from Fetch Metadata headers**, covered in section 1 and already in aspnet-core.md's aside. `khalid`'s account of what it rejects is the part to watch, since a SPA token exchange and possibly a `form_post` provider callback are affected.
- **`X25519DiffieHellman` and unpadded AES key wrap on `Aes`**, plus "TLS handshake hardening, certificate-validation alerts on Linux, channel binding validation on Unix".
- **A redesign of `unsafe` in C#** into a compiler-enforced contract between callers and API authors, an opt-in C# 16 feature previewing in .NET 11 and targeted for production in .NET 12 ([Lander: Improving C# Memory Safety](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/improving-csharp-memory-safety/), 2026-05-21).
- **A CSP-compliant `Virtualize` component** in Blazor, which removes the .NET 8 to 10 conflict noted under output encoding.

## Where the sources disagree

1. **Post-quantum support on Windows.** `ms-learn`'s cross-platform page, reviewed 2026-08-03, still lists ML-KEM and ML-DSA on Windows as "Windows 11 Insiders (Latest)". `dotnet-blog` said on 2025-11-18 that "Windows support arrived this month". The blog is a later primary statement by the engineer who shipped the feature and the Learn table looks unrevised, so this topic follows the blog.
2. **What a lock file is for.** Integrity (`meziantou`), repeatability (`ms-learn`), or drift protection (this repository's template). All three are true of the same file. The template's framing is the weakest, and the only one that makes the file sound optional in every case.
3. **Where NuGet Audit runs.** `ms-learn` presents switching it off in CI as a supported choice. The **House:** rule says a check runs everywhere or fires late. House wins, and the sourced option would be recorded as the community default this repository declines.
4. **Password-based key derivation.** `ms-learn` and `damien-bowden` both land on PBKDF2 through `Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2`, and OWASP prefers Argon2id (**unvetted**). Only the two roster positions are citable, and PBKDF2 is the BCL's only option, so they stand.
5. **Partitioning rate limits by IP.** `milan-jovanovic` (2023) endorses it for anonymous traffic, and aspnet-core.md forbids partitioning on spoofable headers. They are compatible once the opinion separates the connection address from a forwarded header (section 1).
6. **Issuing your own tokens.** `milan-jovanovic` argues for an identity provider in one post and teaches self-issued JWTs in another, and `code-with-mukesh` teaches the latter. `damien-bowden`'s catalogue assumes an identity provider throughout, which settles the question by weight rather than by argument.

## Freshness

`ms-learn` review dates are each page's `ms.date`, per the roster rule. The editor re-read four of these pages directly (NU1901–NU1904, releases and support, the Blazor OIDC page and cross-platform cryptography); the rest are `ms.date` values reported by worker agents.

The bold dates are the ones to weigh. The EF Core page describes an API that has not changed since EF Core 7, so its age does not weaken the claim. The cryptography model page is older than AES-GCM's prominence and every post-quantum type, and `damien-bowden`'s 2024 hashing post now covers the one part of it this topic relies on. The container-images page is why chiseled images get no recommendation here.

On the roster blogs, `meziantou`'s security catalogue is mostly 2019–2020, and only the NuGet posts from 2022 and 2024 are recent enough to lean on. `andrew-lock`'s security writing splits into a current run from 2025 to 2026 and a 2016–2023 back catalogue that predates .NET 8. `steve-gordon`'s AES-GCM series is from 2026. `damien-bowden`'s material is current across every topic cited here, from 2024 to 2026, with one exception recorded in place: his Data Protection writing is from 2016 to 2019. `khalid`'s Duende posts run from 2025-03 to 2026-09, and his personal blog has published nothing since 2025-04-22, so the widened scope is what makes him current.

Preview-gated: everything in section 6, plus `SlhDsa`, `CompositeMLDsa` and the experimental members of `MLKem` and `MLDsa`.

## What this reveals about the repository

1. **Security needs a home, and `resolve-research` should choose between two.** Supply chain fits [ci.md](../opinions/ci.md) and the templates and should go there. Application and runtime security fits no existing file. [aspnet-core.md](../opinions/aspnet-core.md) could absorb authorization defaults, cookies and BFF, Data Protection, CORS, HTTPS, security headers and open redirects, but secrets, deserialization and cryptography are not ASP.NET Core topics. The editor's recommendation is a new `opinions/security.md` for those, with aspnet-core.md keeping the HTTP-pipeline items and linking across. Either way the new file needs its README entries in the same pull request.

2. **The template's warnings rule needs its NuGet Audit consequence written down.** A comment in [templates/Directory.Build.props](../templates/Directory.Build.props) should say that NU1901–NU1904 fail restore on purpose, with `NuGetAuditSuppress` plus a stated reason as the only accepted escape. The house rule already implies this, so it is the rule applied rather than a new opinion, and `resolve-research` can weave it.

3. **ci.md's signing section is stale on credentials.** Trusted publishing is GA and nuget.org API keys now last 30 days. That is `harvest-sources` work, since `dotnet-blog` and `andrew-lock` published it, and it should land before 2026-11-01, when every older nuget.org key expires.

4. **aspnet-core.md has three gaps of its own making, one of them new this pass.** It ships containers without saying where the Data Protection keys live. It credits SDK container publish with patching that only happens on rebuild. And its passkeys opinion should carry the `amr` caveat while [dotnet/aspnetcore#64881](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64881) stays open, because a reader building step-up authentication on top of it will get a wrong answer from the claim.

5. **Four areas moved from blocked to ready, all through one admission.** Browser authentication and BFF, the security-header baseline, password hashing parameters, and token-binding practice (DPoP, PAR, client assertions) are all `damien-bowden`. That is worth noticing as a roster result rather than only a research one: one well-chosen admission closed more of this topic's map than the previous four passes of sweeping did.

6. **The two gaps that remain are narrow.** API-key handling still rests on one **Corroborate.** source, and `damien-bowden` does not cover it, which was the best remaining hope. No source recommends a setting for `AnalysisModeSecurity`. Both stay open rather than being filled from general knowledge.

7. **A correction this topic owes, and what the `vet-source` pass settled.** The first pass ranked Barry Dorrans the strongest of seven candidates on the strength of his subject-matter authority. The roster checked the thing the ranking assumed and found it wrong: idunno.org has been a blog only since 2025-11-18, and the decade before it was a static conference page, so the run that counts is under a year. The candidate ranked second, `damien-bowden`, is the one admission and the one that moved this topic. **The lesson for the next pass is that a research topic ranks candidates by the gap they would fill, which is not the same question `vet-source` asks, and it should say which question it is answering.** The rest: `khalid` widened, `duende-blog` and `scott-brady` watch-listed, and the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series and Philippe De Ryck never taken up, the first still unvetted and the second out of scope.

8. **One lead for a future `vet-source` pass.** The passkey and antiforgery deep-dives on the Duende blog carry Maarten Balliauw's byline rather than Khalid's, so they are not citable through the widened scope. He has a long personal publishing record that this topic has not examined, and passkeys are an opinion this repository already holds with a single source behind it. Worth a look the next time the roster is opened, on the same terms that admitted `khalid`'s byline rather than the publication.
